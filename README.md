Task project is designed to run tasks in reliable manner.
It can run as a stand alone app or be embedded into another akka project both as publisher(s) and/or consumer(s). 

Use cases would be queueing, live data migration, sending events to Mixpanel, download files from a server and put on S3, etc.

## Current features
 * Sending a message from actor A to B in a reliable way (proxy consumers)
 * Segment consumer
 * Push consumer (Apns, Gcm, Urban Airship)
 * Currently RabbitMQ is used as queueing provider but can be swapped out in favor of kafka or something else
 * Later persistent actors can be used instead of queueing

## Dependencies

 * Java (latest preferred)
 * Sbt (check project/build.properties for version)
 * Currently Rabbit is used, makes sure it's running on localhost:5672 and user guest/guest is enabled or modify config
 
## Future contributions

 * Kafka backend
 * Support for json maessages to have non scala producers also
 * Designated S3 consumer to put content on S3, to download files from other servers and put on S3
 * Designated Mixpanel consumer
